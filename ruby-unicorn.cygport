SUMMARY="Ruby Rack low-latency HTTP server"
DESCRIPTION="Unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only
serve fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels. Slow clients should only be
served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering both the the
request and response in between Unicorn and slow clients."
